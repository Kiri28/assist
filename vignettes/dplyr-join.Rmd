# Joins

dplyr implements the four most useful joins from SQL

Many to one on

* nothing specified: common variables
* `by = "varname"`: common named variable
* `c("origin" = "faa")`: different variables

left_join(x, y) includes all observations in x, regardless of whether they match or not. This is the most commonly used join because it ensures that you donâ€™t lose observations from your primary table. 

If a match is not unique, a join will add all possible combinations.

* left_join(x, y): all x + matching y
* right_join(x, y): equivalent to left_join(y, x)
* inner_join(x, y): keep only matching x + y
* full_join() includes all observations from x and y.

## Filtering joins

* semi_join(x, y): all x with match in y
* anti_join(x, y): all x without match in y

## Set operations

* intersect(x, y): all rows in both x and y
* union(x, y): rows in either x or y
* setdiff(x, y): rows in x, but not y
